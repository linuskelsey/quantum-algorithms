# quantum-algorithms

A collection of quantum algorithms, as compiled in [Qiskit](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/), the Python library for Quantum Computing developed by IBM.

Algorithm's are taken from Arthur Ekert and Tim Hosgood's highly comprehensive [notes](https://qubit.guide/index), which I studied in 2022 as part of his Introduction to Quanum Information course.
